module Amber::Router::Parsers
  module Multipart
    # Parse a multipart form and, when the payload is small enough, hand the
    # request body back afterwards.
    #
    # Amber parses the body for its OWN reasons long before user code runs — the
    # CSRF plug looks for `_csrf` in `context.params` on every state-changing
    # request — so a controller behind the :web pipeline read `request.body` and
    # got "" on every file-upload POST. Measured on a running server: 628 bytes
    # declared, 0 readable.
    #
    # The urlencoded parser solves this by buffering the body in an IO::Memory.
    # That is NOT safe here. A multipart body carries file uploads and can be
    # arbitrarily large, and Router::File streams each part to disk precisely so
    # that uploads never sit in memory; buffering the payload in RAM would undo
    # that and turn a large upload into a memory-exhaustion vector. So the body
    # is spooled to a TEMPFILE instead, and that spool is deleted at request
    # teardown along with the uploads themselves.
    #
    # The spool is bounded by `Amber.settings.multipart_body_restore_limit`.
    # Above the cap — or when Content-Length is absent, as with a chunked body —
    # nothing is spooled and the body is left drained, which is exactly the
    # pre-existing behaviour. An oversized upload therefore degrades to what
    # Amber did before rather than filling the disk.
    #
    # Returns the parsed params, the files, and the spool (nil when the body was
    # not spooled) so that Params can delete it at teardown.
