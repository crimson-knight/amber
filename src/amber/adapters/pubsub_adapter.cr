module Amber::Adapters
  # Abstract base class for pub/sub messaging adapters used by WebSocket channels.
  #
  # All pub/sub implementations should inherit from this class and implement
  # the required abstract methods. This allows the Amber framework to work with
  # any messaging backend (Redis, in-memory, database, message queues, etc.) 
  # through a unified interface.
  #
  # Example implementation:
  #
  # ```
  # class CustomPubSubAdapter < Amber::Adapters::PubSubAdapter
  #   def initialize(@message_broker : MyMessageBroker)
  #   end
  #
  #   def publish(topic : String, sender_id : String, message : JSON::Any) : Nil
  #     @message_broker.send_message(topic, {sender: sender_id, msg: message}.to_json)
  #   end
  #
  #   # ... implement other abstract methods
  # end
  # ```
  abstract class PubSubAdapter

    # - `sender_id`: Unique identifier of the message sender (usually client socket ID)
    # - `message`: The message content to publish

    #
    # - `topic`: The topic/channel to subscribe to  
    # - `block`: Callback that receives (sender_id, message) for each published message
    #
    # Note: The sender_id allows subscribers to filter out their own messages if needed.
