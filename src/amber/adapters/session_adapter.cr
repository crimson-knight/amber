module Amber::Adapters
  # Abstract base class for session storage adapters.
  # 
  # All session storage implementations should inherit from this class and implement
  # the required abstract methods. This allows the Amber framework to work with
  # any backend storage system (Redis, database, memory, etc.) through a unified interface.
  #
  # Example implementation:
  #
  # ```
  # class CustomSessionAdapter < Amber::Adapters::SessionAdapter
  #   def initialize(@connection : MyStorageConnection)
  #   end
  #
  #   def get(session_id : String, key : String) : String?
  #     @connection.fetch("#{session_id}:#{key}")
  #   end
  #
  #   # ... implement other abstract methods
  # end
  # ```

    # Retrieves a value for the given key within the specified session.
    # Returns the value as a String, or nil if the key doesn't exist.

    # Sets a value for the given key within the specified session.
    abstract def set(session_id : String, key : String, value : String) : Nil
    
    # Deletes a specific key from the session.

    # Completely destroys the session and all its data.
    abstract def destroy(session_id : String) : Nil

    # Checks if a specific key exists within the session.

    # Returns all keys present in the session.

    # (like session_id) as empty for application purposes.
